# What's all this?

I'm a journalist and software engineer who has worked with both the world's largest news organizations and solo operations just getting off the ground. Currently, I'm a deputy director at [News Catalyst](https://newscatalyst.org) and the director of technology at the [Tiny News Collective](https://tinynewsco.org). I used to work at Politico and NPR, building [election results reporting systems](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/house/), [bespoke visual stories](https://apps.npr.org/life-after-death/), and [newsroom tooling](https://github.com/nprapps/lunchbox).

But work isn't my life, and I never talk about things I enjoy aside from the errant tweet. I've let my digital life only express the work over the past few years. I want to talk more about the play.

This site is my playground, a personal space to write and explore new ideas. Sometimes it'll be about work. Sometimes it'll be about nu metal. It's free-form and liable to change at any moment. I don't have a publishing schedule. I don't have subscriber goals. I'm not tracking engagement. [I'm just riffin', baby](https://twitter.com/rich_hofmann/status/1329306619700785155?lang=en).

Knowing myself, I will probably have furious spurts of activity here, and then I'll drop off for months at a time. My topics will vary wildly and without warning. [I'll commit to big projects and only do two editions](https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/7/15/20691544/sufjan-stevens-50-states-illinois-michigan-seven-swans-indie-folk-pitchfork). And I'm fine with that. We all need exploratory spaces. I'm trying to keep this one as low-pressure as possible.

## How'd you build this thing?

I was tempted to build a whole custom website for this, but that was a surefire way of ensuring I'd never launch anything. Instead, this website is built on [Ghost](https://ghost.org), based on one of their free themes called [Journal](https://ghost.org/themes/journal/). Yes, I'm currently building [my own CMS](https://tinynewsco.org/about/resources) for work, but it's not meant for personal blogs, and I've always been fascinated and inspired by Ghost's approach. This felt like a good excuse to try it out (and maybe do a little competitive research).

I'm hosting this on the base [Ghost Pro plan](https://ghost.org/pricing/), which is a pretty good deal considering it configures Mailgun for you. If this grows beyond my wildest dreams I'll have to reconsider, since it gets pricey at a certain member level, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

## There's a newsletter. Should I subscribe?

Yeah, if you want! Ghost will let me send all my posts as newsletter editions, and I'll do that if people sign up. Right now, there's no difference between posts on the site and what will go in the newsletter. Who knows, maybe that'll change? Fair warning though, my topics and frequency are going to vary wildly. Don't sign up expecting a weekly developer blog.
